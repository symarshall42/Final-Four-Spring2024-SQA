What we learned:
Alden- When I was looking over the different python files, I realized the true importance that forensics has in producing accurate results from a model. In a project this size, it is important to incorporate forensics and logs in order to keep track of what inputs are going into which functions and the outputs that are produced. It helps when trying to figure out where a program encounters an error and why that error occurred. I added forensics to the report.py file because I thought it was important to log what files were getting put into the report so that the outputs would be based on the correct data.
