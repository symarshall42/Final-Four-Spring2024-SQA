What we learned:
Alden - When I was looking over the different python files, I realized the true importance that forensics has in producing accurate results from a model. In a project this size, it is important to incorporate forensics and logs in order to keep track of what inputs are going into which functions and the outputs that are produced. It helps when trying to figure out where a program encounters an error and why that error occurred. I added forensics to the report.py file because I thought it was important to log what files were getting put into the report so that the outputs would be based on the correct data. 

Blake - I implemented continuous integration with GitHub Actions. Integrating Codacy into our CI pipeline provided immediate feedback on code quality issues, allowing us to address them early in the development process. This helped in maintaining a high standard of code quality and reducing technical debt. Codacy offers a wide range of code quality checks out of the box. However, customizing these checks to suit our specific project requirements was crucial. We learned to fine-tune the Codacy configuration to focus on the most relevant issues for our codebase.
